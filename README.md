# dpolcat

*dpolcat* is a tool for the semantic categorization of dual-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. (Specifically, Sentinel-1 with VV and VH polarizations at present.)

It is inspired by Dr. Andrea Baraldi's [Satellite Image Automatic Mapper‚Ñ¢](http://siam.andreabaraldi.com/) (SIAM‚Ñ¢) concept of *spectral categories* for optical data, and the [Sen2Cube](https://www.sen2cube.at/) project.

Status: Effectively at prototype/proof of concept stage, under active development.

## Overview

Different objects on the earth's surface scatter the microwave signals that radar satellites emit and receive, in different ways.

![Scatterer types](media/scatterer-types.png)

We bin the backscatter received in the same- (VV) and cross-polarized (VH) signals into distinct *polarimetric categories* that give a hint at what's on the ground.

We can then make inferences based on how these categories are distributed in an area, or change over time.

This is implemented in a Python module that performs a custom scaling, then categorization using a decision-tree algorithm.

![Block diagram](media/block-diagram.png).

It uses the [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) just-in-time compiler to increase performance, and [Dask](https://www.dask.org) for parallelization.

## Environment

Development and processing are supported within a [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/) Jupyter Python environment.

These environments are based on [Pangeo](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-docker-images). This may be an option for use on other platforms, though connection to the EO imagery archive would need to be changed accordingly.
