# dpolcat

*dpolcat* is a tool for the semantic categorization of dual-polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. (Specifically, Sentinel-1 with VV and VH polarizations at present.)

Status: Effectively at prototype/proof of concept stage, under active development.


## Environment

Development and processing are supported within a [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/) Jupyter Python environment.

These environments are based on [Pangeo](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-docker-images). This may be an option for use on other platforms, though connection to the EO imagery archive would need to be changed accordingly.
